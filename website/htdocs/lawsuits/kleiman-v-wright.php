										<h2>Kleiman v. Wright (Southern District of Florida)</h2>
									</header>

									<h3>Background</h3>
									<UL>
										
									<p>
										Dave Kleiman’s estate just filed a claim against Craig Wright. The lawsuit was filed by Boies Schiller 
										Flexner lawyers Devin "Velvel" Freedman (https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/velvel-devin-freedman.html) 
										and Kyle Roche (https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/kyle-roche.html). It claims that shortly after Dave' 
										death, Craig employed an elaborate scheme to steal between 550K and 1.1M bitcoins and other 
										intellectual property owned by W&K Info Defense Research LLC - a Florida company Dave owned.
									</P>
									
									<P>
										The complaint publishes documents evidencing a long history between Craig and Dave, including documents 
										demonstrating their early involvement in Bitcoin mining. Interestingly, while the complaint discusses 
										Craig’s claim to be Satoshi, it seems to really focus on evidence Craig and Dave mined bitcoin – as Satoshi’s 
										identity is irrelevant to whether Craig stole from Dave.

									</P>
									
									<P>
										The lawsuit, brought by Dave Kleiman's relatives (Kleiman passed away in 2013) largely recounts the story as presented 
										by Craig Wright (in public or privately), that Wright and Kleiman together were involved in the creation of Bitcoin and 
										owned a large number of bitcoins, taking these claims at face value. At the same time, the lawsuit represents Wright as 
										fraudulent and untrustworthy, having forged a number of documents for various financial gains.
									</P>
									
									<P>
										Ultimately, this is a case of self-serving reasoning that doesn't hold up to scrutiny; if Wright falsifies and 
										invents facts to suit his own purposes in one part, why would he be considered a trustworthy source for the other 
										information? Most of Wright's narrative is full of holes and provably false, and the lawsuit spends much of its time 
										recounting Wright's numerous lies over time. Time to connect the final dots and include the so called 1,100,000 bitcoins 
										in the list of falsehoods.
