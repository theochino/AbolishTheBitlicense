									<h3>Background</h3>
									<UL>
									<p>
										This is a simple drug case disguized to demonize bitcoin to the lawmakers.<BR>
									</p>
									
									<P>
										This case has nothing to do with bitcoin other than the governement alleges that the 
										defendant has used bitcoin to be able to get paid for the alleged contraband. 
									</P>

									<P>
										The reason to follow this case is simply to make sure the governement doens't 
										demonize Bitcoin to the lawmakers and to understand how the governement 
										managed to uncover the identity of the Frenchman using bitcoin.
