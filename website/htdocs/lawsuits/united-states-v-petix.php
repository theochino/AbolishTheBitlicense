										<h2>United States v. Petix (1:15-cr-00227)</h2>
									</header>

									<h3>Background</h3>
									<UL>
										<P>
											This case is important because it's the first time a Federal Magistrate judge wrote
											<A HREF="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nywd.105501/gov.uscourts.nywd.105501.36.0.pdf" TARGET="opinion">an opinion on whether 18 U.S.C. ยง 1960 is money or not</A>. 
											The document is not binding since 
											the judge never entered it on evidence and force Petix to take the plea.							
										</P>
										
										<P>
											Two cases have used this logic, one unsuccessfully, <A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-mansy.php">US v. Mansy</A>, and 
											one that became moot when the US dropped the charges, <A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-costanzo.php">US v. Costanzo</A>.<BR>
											A third case, <A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-lord.php">US v. Lord</A>, Randall Lord had already 
											plead guilty but wanted to change his plea
											to not guilty and argue on the basis of the Petix report.	
											That case is on appeal.
