										<h2>USA vs Stetkiw (2:17-mj-30566 & 2:18-cr-20579) </h2>
									</header>

									<h3>Background</h3>
									<UL>
										
										<P>
											The first case was that of a trader in detroit and a few days after Costanzo case, the Stetkiw case was dropped.<BR>
											On August 28, 2018 the goverment claimed to have found child ponography on his computers and will 
											most likelly be making the case that bitcoin enables child pornography.
										</P>
										
										<P>
											Sick people uses any means possible to get access their addiction and bitcoin doesn't enable it more than any other barthering 
											method available. The federal governement need to use it's investigative power to prevent the cause of child pornography
											instead of going after the bitcoins. Free uses of Bitcoin might actually help the tracing of child pornography networks and the
											subsequent arrest of any ring leader.
										</P>
