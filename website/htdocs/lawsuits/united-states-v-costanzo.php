										</P>
										
										<P>
											This case was going to test the theory whether bitcoin is money un 18 U.S.C. 1960, however
											the US governement dropped those 2 charges against Peter and Thomas.
										</P>
										
										<P>
											The judge granted the defence motion about dropping the charge of a felon in possession of ammunitions 
											leaving Thomas with 5 counts of Money Laundering.
										</p>
										
										<P>
											Both Thomas and Peter are Liberterian activists and leaving by the same code of conduct. Their story
											was reported by 
											<A HREF="https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/216911-2017-04-25-update-on-morhpeus-titania-aka-thomas-costanzo-arrested-4-20.htm">Donna and Ernest Hancock of Freedoms Phoenix</A>.
										</P>
										
										<P>
											Peter Steimetz was initialy defended by Brian Klein, chair of the 
											<A HREF="https://www.dcldc.org" TARGET="new">Digital Currency & Ledger Defence Coalition.</A> 
											<I>(same lawyer that defended <A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-murgio.php">Anthony Murgio</A> and 
												<A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-wagner.php">Burt Wagner</A>)</I> and Thomas Costanzo is being 
												defended by the Phoenix Public Defendant Office.
										</P>

										<P>
											Peter Steimetz strategy is outlined in 
											<A HREF="https://coincenter.org/entry/does-18-u-s-c-1960-create-felony-liability-for-bitcoin-businesses" TARGET="new">Coincenter Blog titled Does 18 U.S.C. ยง1960 create felony liability for bitcoin businesses</A> 
											and Thomas Costanzo strategy is outlined in the <A HREF="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nywd.105501/gov.uscourts.nywd.105501.36.0.pdf" TARGET="new">Magistrate Judge Scott non binding document that 
											bitcoin is not money or funds under section 1960</A> presented during <A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-petix.php">US v. Petix</A> in the Western District of New York.
										</P>
										
										<P>
											Peter strategy was successfully used for incidental transactions whereas Thomas strategy is still being tested.
										</P>
	
										<P>
											The two cases that can potentially answer that questions are <A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-petix.php">US v. Stetkiw</A> and
											<A HREF="/lawsuits/united-states-v-petix.php">US v.Rockcoons</A> and maybe <A HREF="">US v. Lord</A> if he wins his appeal
											to change his plea. Since those first two cases are pending, the decision lies with Brad and Morgan.
